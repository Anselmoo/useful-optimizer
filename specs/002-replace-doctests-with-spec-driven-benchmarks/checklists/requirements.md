# Specification Quality Checklist: Replace trivial doctests with spec-driven benchmark tests

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-25
**Feature**: ../002-replace-doctests-with-spec-driven-benchmarks/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) leaked into the spec
- [ ] Focused on user value and testability
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed in the spec

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
