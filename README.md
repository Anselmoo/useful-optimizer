## Installation

To install Useful Optimizer, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Anselmoo/useful-optimizer
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Useful Optimizer:

```python
from opt.benchmark import CrossEntropyMethod
from opt.benchmark.functions import shifted_ackley

optimizer = CrossEntropyMethod(
        func=shifted_ackley,
        dim=2,
        lower_bound=-12.768,
        upper_bound=+12.768,
        population_size=100,
        max_iter=1000,
    )
best_solution, best_fitness = optimizer.search()
print(f"Best solution: {best_solution}")

```

You can also use the new gradient-based optimizers:

```python
from opt.stochastic_gradient_descent import SGD

# Gradient-based optimization
sgd = SGD(func=shifted_ackley, lower_bound=-12.768, upper_bound=12.768, dim=2, learning_rate=0.01)
best_solution, best_fitness = sgd.search()

# Adam variant with weight decay
adamw = AdamW(func=shifted_ackley, lower_bound=-12.768, upper_bound=12.768, dim=2, weight_decay=0.01)
best_solution, best_fitness = adamw.search()

# Quasi-Newton method
bfgs = BFGS(func=shifted_ackley, lower_bound=-12.768, upper_bound=12.768, dim=2, num_restarts=10)
best_solution, best_fitness = bfgs.search()
```
