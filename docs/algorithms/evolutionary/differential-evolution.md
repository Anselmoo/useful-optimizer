Differential Evolution (DE) Algorithm.

## Algorithm Overview

This module implements the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. DE is a
population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm developed
by R. Storn and K. Price in 1997. It is simple, robust, and has proven to be effective
for a wide range of optimization problems.

DE generates new candidate solutions by combining existing ones according to its simple
formulae. For each iteration/generation, new solutions are generated by adding the
weighted difference between two solutions to a third solution. If the generated
solution has better fitness than the current solution in consideration, it replaces
the current solution.

DE is particularly useful for numerical optimization problems that are computationally
intensive, non-differentiable, noisy, discontinuous, and multimodal.

## Usage

```python
from opt.evolutionary.differential_evolution import DifferentialEvolution
from opt.benchmark.functions import sphere

optimizer = DifferentialEvolution(
    func=sphere,
    lower_bound=-5.12,
    upper_bound=5.12,
    dim=10,
    max_iter=500,
    population_size=50,
)

best_solution, best_fitness = optimizer.search()
print(f"Best solution: {best_solution}")
print(f"Best fitness: {best_fitness:.6e}")
```
