"""Helper scripts for repository maintenance and pre-commit checks.

This package provides small utility scripts executed by pre-commit hooks
(e.g., docstring style checks). It is not intended as a runtime package and
exists only to satisfy tooling expectations (avoid implicit namespace
package warnings).
